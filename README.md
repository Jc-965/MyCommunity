# MyCommunity

MyCommunity is a mobile application built to keep Boy Scouts actively connected with their troops and local communities. The troop-finder feature allows scout leaders to register their troop, customize a profile with meeting details and activities, and pin its location on an interactive map so scouts and families can easily discover and join nearby groups. To make service projects more relevant and timely, the app integrates a curated news feed powered by the New York Times API, which highlights current issues such as natural disasters, local events, or community needs. This helps scout leaders select projects that directly respond to real-world circumstances, ensuring scouts contribute in ways that are both meaningful and impactful.
