# MyCommunity
MyCommunity helps Boy Scouts stay connected and engaged with their communities. The app includes a troop-finder feature, allowing scout leaders to create a troop and add it to the map. To allow scout leaders to choose more relevant service projects that correspond to current events, the app integrates a news feed powered by the New York Times API.
